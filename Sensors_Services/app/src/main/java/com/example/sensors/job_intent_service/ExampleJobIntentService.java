// JobIntentService uses two classes : IntentService and JobService. Since android oreo ( api 26 ) we can't keep normal services running in the background anymore
// because system will kill them after around one minute or throws an exception if we try to start the service while app itself is in the background. This happens
// to save the system resources like battery so that it can run for a long time.

// Helper for processing work that has been enqueued for a job/service. When running on Android O or later, the work will be dispatched as a job via
// JobScheduler.enqueue(). When running on older versions of the platform, it will use Context.startService. You must publish your subclass in your manifest for
// the system to interact with. This should be published as a JobService, as described for that class, since on O and later platforms it will be executed that way.
// Use enqueueWork(Context, Class, int, Intent) to enqueue new work to be dispatched to and handled by your service. It will be executed in onHandleWork(Intent).
// One of Androidâ€™s greatest strengths is its ability to use system resources in the background regardless app execution. sometimes it became the behaviour to
// use system resources excessively.

// On android O or later it uses JobScheduler to achieve the similar behaviour as an intent service. It starts the work as soon as possible and it executes the
// all the incoming intents sequentially one after another on the background thread. When it finishes it's work it stops automatically. Most of the stuffs what
// be write related to JobScheduler is handled internally in JobIntentService. There will be no notification hence it maximizes the battery life. It will
// do the work internally without any notification and stops as soon as we closes our app. Onwards android oreo the app running in background can't keep it's
// background service running anymore instead the system will stop the service to save the memory and battery. So if want to do some background work like
// networking operation then in most cases we use JobScheduler. Job scheduler is used mainly to do the work in the background. Instead of scheduling the
// background works solly based on time you can define the certain criteria like if the device if connected to wifi or if its currently charging and then
// system will decide when exactly it will run your job and it will be try to intelligent about it. Usually it will batch different jobs together.

// A wake lock is a mechanism to indicate that your application needs to have the device stay on. Any application using a WakeLock must request the
// android. permission. WAKE_LOCK permission in an <uses-permission> element of the application's manifest.
